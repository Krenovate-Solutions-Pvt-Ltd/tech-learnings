So, it's up to you by which plugin you want to go with if you have a pro license of ACF then I will suggest definetely go with the ACF and get rid of the extra plugin depandancy.</p> <p>The code implementation is also very straight forward. We have one WordPress method <code>register_post_type()</code> which registers/creates a custom post type. To read more about this function refer this doc Include the code given below in theme's function.php file.</p> <pre><code>function create_blog_post_type() {\n    register_post_type('blog',\n        array(\n            'labels' =&gt; array(\n                'name' =&gt; __('Blogs'),\n                'singular_name' =&gt; __('Blog')\n            ),\n            'public' =&gt; true,\n            'has_archive' =&gt; true,\n            'rewrite' =&gt; array('slug' =&gt; 'blogs'),\n        )\n    );\n}\nadd_action('init', 'create_blog_post_type');\n</code></pre> <p>This will create an custom post type in the admin dashboard and you can now create as many posts inside this custom post type(CPT). But now if we need to display the listing or content of these posts in UI we need to create templates and you can create custom templates for your CPT by adding template files like <code>single-blog.php</code> and <code>archive-blog.php</code> in your theme. <code>single-blog.php</code> is for the template file for displaying the UI for your blogs and <code>archive-blog.php</code> is the file to display the UI for listing or index page of blogs.</p> <p>Please Note: In both ways either plugin or custom code to create CPT we need to create these template files.</p>"},{"location":"cpt-or-options-page/#acf-option-pages","title":"ACF Option Pages","text":"<p>ACF Option Pages allow for the creation of global settings and content that are not tied to any specific post or page, providing a centralized place for site-wide configurations.

In some cases we may not require the the post urls that are auto generating with each posts and we can disable that by passing the below two arguments to the post creation function: <pre><code>    'publicly_queryable'  =&gt; false, // Disable single post pages\n    'rewrite'             =&gt; false,\n</code></pre></li> </ol>"},{"location":"image-alt-tag/","title":"Image Alt Tag","text":""},{"location":"image-alt-tag/#image-alt-tag-customization","title":"Image alt tag customization","text":"<p>This section is required for the good SEO performance.

This will be very helpful in improving webpage performance and speed optimization.</p> <p>Now, the thing comes in mind that Do we need to manually convert all the jpgs/jpegs to WebP? The answer is no. There is a WordPress plugin that will do the job for you what you need to do is just install and activate the Modern Image Formats developed by WordPress Performance Team.</p> <p>As far as the plugin version 2.0.1 is released it gives you support for both WebP and AVIF image formats. You can select any in our case we are using WebP as AVIF is only supported in some latest versions of Chrome. So, there are cross browser compatibility isssue with AVIF format. If you want to read more about AVIF image format you can refer this doc.</p> <p>Here you can see the basic settings that we need in our case.</p> <p></p> <p>Please Note: This plugin only converts the images that will get uploaded to media after activating the plugin.

But when we need to use react.js for frontend we can't directly use this method inside the react components as we are restricted to add the php code inside javascript files. So, here we have a workaround for this by using the following ways:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Pass site url as a HTML attribute from the react component containing HTML Element(div, section, etc.). We can use the main HTML element from the template file(app.blade.php) to set an atrribute. <code>&lt;main id=\"main\" class=\"main\" site-url=\"{{ get_site_url() }}\"&gt;</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Then we need to read the attribute value inside js file using <code>getAttribute()</code> method and store it inside a variable. We can create the variable inside App.js file so that it is accessible for all components. <code>const site_url = document.getElementById('main').getAttribute('site-url');</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Now, we can pass the variable to multiple components as a props and can use it to set a base URL for relative URL's. <code>&lt;MainMenu siteUrl={siteUrl} /&gt;</code></p> </li> </ul> <p>Moreover, Instead of passing it as prop to each component, Alternatively we can create one method in App.js and then we can import that method inside the component something like this:</p> <p>App.js</p> <pre><code>const baseURL = (urlString) =&gt; {\n  let site_url = null;\n  if (urlString.indexOf('http://') === 0 || urlString.indexOf('https://') === 0 \n  || urlString.indexOf('www') === 0 || urlString.indexOf('mailto') === 0 || \n  urlString.indexOf('tel') === 0) {\n    site_url = '';\n  } else {\n    site_url = document.getElementById('main').getAttribute('site-url');\n  }\n\n  return site_url+urlString;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>YourComponent.js</p> <pre><code>import baseUri from '@scripts/app';\nconst YourComponent = () =&gt; {\n    return(\n        &lt;&gt;\n            &lt;a href={baseUri('/example')}&gt;Your Component&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;/&gt;\n    )\n}\nexport default YourComponent\n</code></pre>"}]}
